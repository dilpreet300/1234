Ans1.
For the first problem i have a model in which
3 regression models that are xgboost regressor,
random forest regressor and gradient boosting regressor
and i have stacked together to avoid overfitting of a
single model i have used mean squared error as loss
function and i have tried to minimize it for the catogorical 
features i have used one hot encoder as a transformation
and missing values in continous features are replaced by there
mean and categorical by most frequently occuring value

Ans 2.
In this first i have predicted the value of diuresis on 27 march
using RNN in which i have used LSTM blocks with dropout layers for
regularization and a dense layer for predicting the final value and 
mean squared error as a loss function.I have used 5 previous values to 
predict the 6th value.1 to 5 days are used for training and the target
variable for training is 6th day's value.2 to 6 day's values with target
varible as 7th day's value are used for cross validation and hyper parameter
tuning of model using
